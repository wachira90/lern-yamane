lerning yamane

The Yamane formula is a statistical formula used to estimate the population size of a community based on a sample of individuals from that community. It is often used in ecology and environmental science to estimate the size of animal or plant populations, as well as in social science to estimate the size of human populations.

The formula is as follows:

N = n / (1 - (n-1) / N)

Where:

N is the estimated population size

n is the sample size

The formula works by calculating the number of individuals in the sample that are unique (that is, not captured more than once). This value is then used to estimate the total population size based on the assumption that the proportion of unique individuals in the sample is representative of the entire population.

It is important to note that the Yamane formula is only an estimate and may not be completely accurate. It is often used as a starting point for further analysis and should be validated with other methods.

## example 1

````
Imagine that you are studying the population of a species of birds in a particular area. You set up a number of bird feeders in the area and over the course of a week, you capture and mark a total of 50 birds. Of these 50 birds, you find that 20 are unique (that is, they have not been captured more than once).

To estimate the population size of the birds using the Yamane formula, you would plug the values into the formula as follows:

N = 50 / (1 - (50 - 1) / N)

Solving for N, you get:

N = 50 / (1 - 49/N)

N = 50 / (1 - 49/N) * N

N = 50

Therefore, the estimated population size of the birds is 50.

It is important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual population size could be different. You may want to repeat the study several times or use other methods to validate the estimate.

## example 2

````
Imagine that you are studying the population of a species of fish in a particular lake. You set up a number of nets in the lake and over the course of a week, you capture and mark a total of 100 fish. Of these 100 fish, you find that 40 are unique (that is, they have not been captured more than once).

To estimate the population size of the fish using the Yamane formula, you would plug the values into the formula as follows:

N = 100 / (1 - (100 - 1) / N)

Solving for N, you get:

N = 100 / (1 - 99/N)

N = 100 / (1 - 99/N) * N

N = 100

Therefore, the estimated population size of the fish is 100.

Again, it is important to note that this is just an estimate and the actual population size could be different. You may want to repeat the study several times or use other methods to validate the estimate

## python code

````
def yamane_formula(n: int, N: int) -> int:
    return n / (1 - (n - 1) / N)
````
The function takes two arguments:

n: the sample size
N: the estimated population size
It returns the estimated population size based on the Yamane formula.

You can use the function like this:

````
sample_size = 50
estimated_population_size = yamane_formula(sample_size, estimated_population_size)
print(estimated_population_size)
````

This will print the estimated population size based on a sample size of 50.

## nodejs code

````
function yamaneFormula(n, N) {
  return n / (1 - (n - 1) / N);
}
````

You can use the function like this:


````
const sampleSize = 50;
const estimatedPopulationSize = yamaneFormula(sampleSize, estimatedPopulationSize);
console.log(estimatedPopulationSize);
````

## php code

````
function yamane_formula($n, $N) {
  return $n / (1 - ($n - 1) / $N);
}
````

You can use the function like this:

````
$sample_size = 50;
$estimated_population_size = yamane_formula($sample_size, $estimated_population_size);
echo $estimated_population_size;
````

This will print the estimated population size based on a sample size of 50.
